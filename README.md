# Calculus Labs
These are labs written in python (Jupyter notebooks) for single variable calculus. 

## Student Instructions

These labs are intended to be as "low-entry" as possible. For that reason, I recommend using Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/. You can either upload the file directly (using a Google account) or link to this Github repository (without using a Google account).

### Upload Directly

You can download the specific lab files from this Github rep if you'd like, but direct download links are on our course Canvas site. Once you have those, follow these instructions:

1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Click `File` and then `Open Notebook`
3. In the top menu, click `Upload`, and then click `Browse...`
4. Find the file wherever you saved it, and upload the file.
